<h1>How To Succeed in College</h1>
<div class = "content">
	<h2>Physical</h2>
	<h3>Diet</h3>
	<p>To ensure the greatest success, we would advice a diet high in ice cream. Which contains dairy. We would also advice skipping multiple meals a day and substituting them with delights such as ramen, candy, and energy drinks. If you don't feel sick all the time, you're doing it wrong.</p>
	<h3>Rest</h3>
	<p>You should always clock in either less than three hours or more than fifteen hours of sleep at any one time. If you have already slept a ton, we would suggest extra naps are needed and necessary. If you don't want to face world, sleep. A good time to fit in a nap, is any time a teacher is delivering priceless information that will appear on a future exam.</p>
	<hr>
	<h2>Academic</h2>
	<p>When it comes to due dates, it is important that you never start an assignment more than one hour before it is due. It has been shown that this causes a high level of stress which maximizes creativity and motivation. It is especially good if you can stack multiple assignments due at the same time, to be worked on simultaneously.</p>
	<p>Never read the textbook.</p>

	<hr>
	<h2>Social</h2>
	<p>On the rare occassions you foolishly choose to attend class, be sure to plaster a natural scowl on your visage. This will ensure no academic support is provided by your classmates, and you forever struggle alone. If you are unfortunate enough to come upon a dim-witted numbskull who is evidently immune to your callous ways, you must be strong. Under no circumstances are you to allow them to converse with you in any way outside of class. If an invitation is offered, there is only one response. The sad road of one who falls to this temptation is one of friendship and happiness. This must be avoided at all costs. When possible, never ever leave the apartment, even if you suspect you are dying physically and emotionally. The risk is too great. There are friendly people EVERYWHERE.</p>
